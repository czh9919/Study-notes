# Study Notes

This is my study notes for deep learning and Linear algebra.  
The noets I will write in chinese first, In the future, I will translate to Enlish.

## first step

I don't know if it's better to write notes with markdown or Latex to write notes, but I want to start Latex first, so before I start learning deep learning, let me learn Latex first.

## Reference

The book I used to learn linear algebra is "Linear Algebra Done Right", with a video tutorial from Khan Academy.  
The book I used to learn deep learning is "Deep Learning From Scratch."
